            This paper presents a comprehensive study of Hermite's problem for cubic irrationals, offering three novel approaches for their complete characterization. The problem, first posed by Charles Hermite in 1848, concerns finding necessary and sufficient conditions for the periodicity of sequences derived from cubic irrationals. While previous research has addressed specific cases, our work provides a unified treatment that encompasses all cubic irrationals, including those with complex conjugate roots. We develop the Hermite Algorithm for Periodicity Detection (HAPD) in projective space, a matrix approach using companion matrices and trace sequences, and a modified <InlineMath math={"\\sin^2"} />-algorithm. Our results establish equivalence relationships among these methods and provide explicit algorithms for computation. This work extends existing literature and offers new insights into the algebraic and geometric properties of cubic irrationals.

        <h3>1. Introduction</h3>
        <p>
          In 1848, the mathematician Charles Hermite posed a fundamental question in number theory: What are the necessary and sufficient conditions for the periodicity of sequences derived from cubic irrationals? This problem has profound implications for understanding the structure of algebraic numbers and their representations.

          Let <InlineMath math={"\\alpha"} /> be a cubic irrational, satisfying a minimal polynomial <InlineMath math={"x^3 + ax^2 + bx + c"} /> with rational coefficients. We investigate sequences derived from <InlineMath math={"\\alpha"} /> and establish conditions for their periodicity.

        <h3>2. Background and Definitions</h3>
        <p>
          Before presenting our approaches, we establish key definitions and properties of cubic irrationals.
        </p>
        
        <div className="definition">
          <p><strong>Definition 2.1.</strong> A real number <InlineMath math={"\\alpha"} /> is a <em>cubic irrational</em> if it is a root of an irreducible polynomial of degree 3 with rational coefficients.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div className="theorem">
          <p><strong>Theorem 2.1.</strong> Let <InlineMath math={"\\alpha"} /> be a cubic irrational with minimal polynomial <InlineMath math={"x^3 + ax^2 + bx + c"} />. Then exactly one of the following holds:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>All three roots of the polynomial are real.</li>
            <li><InlineMath math={"\\alpha"} /> is real, and the other two roots form a complex conjugate pair.</li>
          </ol>
        </div>
        
        <p>
          The discriminant <InlineMath math={"\\Delta = -4a^3c + a^2b^2 + 18abc - 4b^3 - 27c^2"} /> determines which case we are in:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>If <InlineMath math={"\\Delta > 0"} />, all roots are real.</li>
          <li>If <InlineMath math={"\\Delta < 0"} />, there is one real root and two complex conjugate roots.</li>
          <li>If <InlineMath math={"\\Delta = 0"} />, there are repeated roots.</li>
        </ul>
