Specifically, each iteration of the \\HAPD{} algorithm is equivalent to a matrix operation on the corresponding companion matrix.\n\\end{theorem}\n\n\\begin{proof}\nConsider a cubic irrational $\\alpha$ with companion matrix $C_\\alpha$. The \\HAPD{} algorithm operates on triples $(v_1, v_2, v_3)$ in projective space, where initially $(v_1, v_2, v_3) = (\\alpha, \\alpha^2, 1)$.\n\nFor the companion matrix approach, trace sequences are computed as $\\operatorname{Tr}(C_\\alpha^n)$. The initial triple $(\\alpha, \\alpha^2, 1)$ corresponds to the powers $\\alpha^1, \\alpha^2, \\alpha^0$.\n\nAt each iteration, the \\HAPD{} algorithm computes integer parts and remainders, then updates the triple. This operation corresponds to a specific transformation in the matrix approach, where the trace of $C_\\alpha^n$ follows the recurrence relation derived from the minimal polynomial.\n\nThe periodicity in the \\HAPD{} algorithm precisely corresponds to the periodicity in the trace sequence modulo certain integers, establishing the structural equivalence.\n\\end{proof}"
