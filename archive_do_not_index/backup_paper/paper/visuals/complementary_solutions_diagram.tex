\caption{Comparison of complementary approaches to Hermite's problem. The HAPD algorithm uses a non-subtractive approach in projective space with matrix-based techniques, while the Modified sin$^2$ algorithm employs a subtractive approach with transcendental functions in the complex plane. Both methods are effective at detecting periodicity in cubic irrationals despite their fundamentally different mathematical foundations.}
