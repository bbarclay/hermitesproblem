# Website Plan: Hermite's Problem Interactive Paper (Refined)

## I. Project Goal & Vision

* **Core Goal:** Build an award-winning, interactive online presentation of the “3 Complete Solutions to Hermite’s Problem” paper — a resource so engaging and rigorous that mathematicians and educators alike will embrace it.
* **Target Audience:**
  * **Primary:** Mathematical researchers, academics, graduate students
  * **Secondary:** Undergraduate mathematics students, instructors
  * **Tertiary:** Science enthusiasts with a moderate-to-advanced math background
* **Vision:** A site that is:
  * **Informative & Rigorous:** Delivers the complete paper’s content accurately, preserving every mathematical nuance from the TeX source.  
  * **Interactive & Exploratory:** Equips users with tools to manipulate formulas, dive into proofs, and simulate scenarios directly from the paper’s solutions.  
  * **Visually Elegant:** Matches the design polish of world-class interactive math sites, taking cues from Apple and BEHANCE for UI/UX inspiration.  
  * **Educational & Sticky:** Facilitates deep understanding and encourages repeat visits by teachers, students, and researchers for lecture demos and self-study.  
  * **Scalable & Modular:** Establishes a robust framework to handle future expansions, additional math papers, and improved interactive modules.
  * **Marketable:** Conveys the novelty and significance of the “3 Complete Solutions” in a way that stands out within academic and broader STEM communities.

## II. Content Strategy

1. **Source Material & Tex File Review**  
   * Read and annotate all `.tex` files from `@arxiv_submission` thoroughly (including any references, cross-references, or footnotes).  
   * Create a granular outline mapping:
     * Each section, subsection, theorem, lemma, equation, figure, and proof structure.
     * Potential spots for interactive elements (e.g., where a diagram or equation would benefit from real-time manipulation).  

2. **Content Conversion & Integration**  
   * **Key Requirement:** Pixel-perfect (or near-perfect) rendering of advanced TeX mathematics, including environments like align, theorem, proof, and any custom macros used in the original paper.  
   * **Possible Implementation Paths:**  
     - **Option A:** Pandoc → MDX → React, leveraging KaTeX or MathJax with specialized MDX components.  
     - **Option B:** Direct custom parsing of TeX (for advanced scenarios with heavy macros or custom environments).  
     - **Option C:** Hybrid approach with rehype-katex for simpler in-text math, and custom React components for interactive or complex math sections.  
   * **Planned Workflow:**  
     1. Build a test corpus with representative TeX constructs (e.g., complicated equations, nested environments, references, footnotes).  
     2. Test rendering performance and fidelity.  
     3. Lock in the final pipeline that balances performance, accuracy, and flexibility.  
     4. Automate content ingestion to facilitate easy updates as the paper evolves.  

3. **Content Enhancement & Teaching Value**  
   * Identify where extended explanations beyond the TeX are beneficial (e.g., extra detail around steps that students typically find challenging).  
   * Implement “hover for definition” or “click for pop-up explanation” for advanced terms or references.  
   * Design “guided pathways” for different user levels (e.g., a simpler walkthrough for undergrads vs. an in-depth approach for seasoned mathematicians).  

4. **Site Structure & User Journey**
