## Overview

This paper introduces three complementary methods for solving **Hermite's Problem** related to **cubic irrationals**:

1. **HAPD Algorithm**: A projective space approach for detecting periodicity in cubic irrationals.
2. **Matrix Approach**: Utilizing companion matrices and trace sequences for analysis.
3. **Modified sin²-Algorithm**: An adaptation for cubic irrationals with complex conjugate roots.
4. **Subtractive Algorithm**: A numerically stable variation of the HAPD algorithm.

These methods are designed to provide a complete characterization of cubic irrationals, a significant challenge in number theory.
