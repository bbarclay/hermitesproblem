# TeX Rendering Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

We've addressed the following TeX rendering issues:

1. **Theorem-like environments with labels and titles**
   - Fixed rendering of theorem, lemma, proposition, corollary, definition, and example environments
   - Added support for optional titles and labels
   - Applied proper styling to each environment type

2. **Equation environments with labels**
   - Fixed rendering of equation, align, eqnarray, gather, and multline environments
   - Added support for equation numbering based on labels
   - Improved styling of math displays

3. **References and citations**
   - Implemented proper rendering of \ref{} commands with clickable links
   - Implemented proper rendering of \cite{} commands
   - Added highlighting effect when clicking on references

4. **Lists and tables**
   - Fixed rendering of itemize, enumerate, and description environments
   - Improved rendering of tabular environments
   - Added proper styling for lists and tables

5. **Math operators and symbols**
   - Fixed rendering of mathbb, mathcal, mathrm, and other math commands
   - Ensured proper math mode for commands outside of math delimiters
   - Added support for special functions like \floor and \ceil

6. **Text formatting**
   - Fixed rendering of \textbf, \textit, and \emph commands
   - Improved styling of formatted text

## Implementation Details

1. **Enhanced TeX Preprocessor**
   - Created comprehensive regex patterns to handle all TeX elements
   - Added special handling for labels and references
   - Implemented proper conversion to HTML/Markdown

2. **Improved TeX Parser Component**
   - Enhanced the parser to handle all TeX elements
   - Added custom components for theorem-like environments
   - Implemented interactive references with highlighting

3. **Specialized CSS Styling**
   - Added custom styles for all TeX elements
   - Implemented visual enhancements for math displays
   - Added animation effects for references

4. **Debugging Tools**
   - Created a debug mode to highlight unparsed elements
   - Added a test page to verify rendering improvements
   - Implemented a scanning script to identify issues

## Results

The TeX rendering system now properly handles all the previously unparsed elements, including:

- Theorem-like environments with labels and titles
- Equation environments with labels and numbering
- References and citations with interactive features
- Lists and tables with proper formatting
- Math operators and symbols with correct rendering
- Text formatting with appropriate styling

These improvements significantly enhance the readability and usability of the mathematical content in the Hermite's Problem website.
