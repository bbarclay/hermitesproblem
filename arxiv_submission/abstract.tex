Hermite's problem asks for an algorithm characterizing cubic irrationals through periodicity, analogous to continued fractions for quadratic irrationals. This paper presents a solution through two approaches: (1) the Hermite Algorithm for Periodicity Detection (HAPD) in projective space, and (2) a modified sin²-algorithm with phase-preserving floor function. Both produce eventually periodic sequences precisely for cubic irrationals, including those with complex conjugate roots—the previously unsolved case. The paper proves their correctness, demonstrates their equivalence through matrix characterization, and provides numerical validation. The solution establishes the pattern connecting periodicity to algebraic degree.
