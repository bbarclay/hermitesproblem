Hermite's problem seeks an algorithm that characterizes cubic irrationals through periodicity, analogous to how continued fractions identify quadratic irrationals. We present a complete solution through three complementary approaches: (1) the Hermite Algorithm for Periodicity Detection (HAPD) operating in projective space, (2) a matrix-based characterization using companion matrices and trace sequence periodicity, and (3) a modified $\sin^2$-algorithm that handles complex conjugate roots via a phase-preserving floor function. Each method produces eventually periodic sequences precisely for cubic irrationals, including those with complex conjugate rootsâ€”previously an unsolved case. We rigorously prove the correctness of each approach, establish their mathematical equivalence, and provide comprehensive numerical validation. Our work creates a unified framework connecting periodicity to algebraic degree for cubic irrationals, resolving a long-standing problem in Diophantine approximation.
