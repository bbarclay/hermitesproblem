Hermite's problem asks for an algorithm characterizing cubic irrationals through periodicity, analogous to continued fractions for quadratic irrationals. This paper presents a complete solution through **three distinct approaches**: (1) the Hermite Algorithm for Periodicity Detection (HAPD) in projective space, (2) a matrix-based characterization using companion matrices and trace sequence periodicity, and (3) a modified sin²-algorithm handling complex conjugate roots via a phase-preserving floor function. All three methods produce eventually periodic structures precisely for cubic irrationals, including those with complex conjugate roots—the previously unsolved case. The paper proves the correctness of each method, demonstrates their equivalence, and provides numerical validation. This work establishes multiple characterizations connecting periodicity to algebraic degree for cubic irrationals.
