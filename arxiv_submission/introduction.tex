\section{Introduction}\label{sec:intro}

Hermite's problem, posed to Jacobi in 1848 \cite{Hermite1848}, sought a generalization of continued fractions that would characterize cubic irrationals through periodicity. Continued fractions produce eventually periodic sequences precisely for quadratic irrationals, but the cubic case with complex conjugate roots remained unsolved.

Previous approaches include:
\begin{itemize}
\item Jacobi-Perron algorithm (1868) \cite{Jacobi1868}: fails for complex conjugate roots
\item Brun's algorithm (1920) \cite{Brentjes1981}: similar limitations
\item Poincaré's geometric approach \cite{KarpenkovBook}: lacks consistent periodicity
\item Karpenkov's sin²-algorithm \cite{Karpenkov2019}: works only for totally-real cubics
\end{itemize}

We resolve Hermite's problem through three novel approaches:
\begin{enumerate}
\item HAPD algorithm in projective space, producing periodic sequences if and only if the input is cubic irrational
\item Matrix characterization using companion matrices and trace sequences with modular periodicity
\item Modified sin²-algorithm handling complex conjugate roots via phase-preserving floor functions
\end{enumerate}
